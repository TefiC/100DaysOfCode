# #100DaysOfCode, Here I Go!

### Day 1 - January 19th, 2019.
  - Solved three challenges on HackerRank.
  - Learned about the differences between var and let on FreeCodeCamp (JavaScript and Data Structures Certification).
  - Completed the chapter on Multiway Tries from UC San Diego's course Data Structures: An Active Learning Approach on edX.
  - Optimized my HackerRank and GitHub Profiles.

**Thoughts**: Today was very rewarding, I really enjoyed solving the HackerRank challenges. I found Multiway Tries very interesting,        and in the next few days I look forward to read more about them.
