# #100DaysOfCode, Here I Go!

### Day 1 - January 19th, 2019.
  - Solved three challenges on HackerRank.
  - Learned about the differences between var and let on FreeCodeCamp. (JavaScript and Data Structures Certification).
  - Completed the chapter on Multiway Tries from UC San Diego's course Data Structures: An Active Learning Approach on edX.
  - Optimized my HackerRank and GitHub Profiles.

**Thoughts**: Today was very rewarding, I really enjoyed solving the HackerRank challenges. I found Multiway Tries very interesting,        and in the next few days I look forward to read more about them. 

### Day 2 - January 20th, 2019.
  - Solved four challenges on HackerRank.
  - Learned about the differences in scope between var and let on FreeCodeCamp.
  - Read about Ternary Seach Trees in UC San Diego's course Data Structures: An Active Learning Approach on edX.
 
**Thoughts**: I'm really enjoying the HackerRank challenges. I think I will keep working on them this year, I can't wait to practice enough to participate in a coding competition! :) Ternary Trees were very interesting. I think this week I will start writing an article on Medium about arrays.
